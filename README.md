# Full Stack Express Template

A typescript-based webapp template using Express, MongoDB and Monk. This template also includes bootstrap and jquery.

## Installation

-   Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org)
-   Launch `npm install`

You will also need to create file named `.env` in the root of the project folder, and create a variable called `MONGO_URI` that points to your mongodb server. Here is an example of the environment file:

```env
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/test"
```

## Running for Development

-   Launch mongo: `mongod --dbpath /tmp`
-   Launch the app: `npm run dev`
-   The server is available on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Building for Production

You can build this app by running `npm run build` in your terminal. If you want to run the app, just run `npm run start`. It will run the build script and then launch the `dist/app.js` file generated by typescript.
